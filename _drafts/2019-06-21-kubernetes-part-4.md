series: Getting Started with Kubernetes (at home)
---

In the first three parts of this series, we looked at setting up and configuring a few services in Kubernetes.

Now we are going to look at my plans for Kubernetes in my homelab. This will not only help me better plan out my lab, but I hope it is also of benefit to others, giving them thoughts and ideas for their own homelabs.

## Istio

Istio is a service mesh that allows you to securely link services together. It allows you to do some fancy things with authentication and authorization to services, and it also has many third party integrations, like https://www.kiali.io/ or https://github.com/reactiveops/polaris or https://anchore.com/opensource/ and https://www.weave.works/oss/scope/
